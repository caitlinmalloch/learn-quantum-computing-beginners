## 🧠 How to Contribute

You don’t need to be an expert in physics or programming to help!  
Here are some easy ways to get started:

### 1. Improve the content
- Fix typos, grammar, or clarity in explanations.
- Simplify technical jargon into plain English.
- Add examples, analogies, or visuals to help beginners learn faster.

### 2. Add learning resources
- Suggest or add links to **free courses, articles, books, or videos** that explain quantum concepts clearly.
- Keep it beginner-friendly — we love approachable, inclusive learning materials.

### 3. Write a new topic
You can create a new markdown file in the right folder (e.g., `/00_basics/` or `/01_algorithms/`) to explain a concept such as:
- What is a qubit?
- What is superposition?
- What is entanglement?
- Quantum gates or circuits  
Keep it short, friendly, and clear — think *“how would I explain this to a friend over coffee?”*

### 4. Help with structure
Suggest new sections, subfolders, or ideas to make the repo easier to navigate.
