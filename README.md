# learn-quantum-computing-beginners
An open-source repo for beginner learning resources on quantum computing

# Why this repo exists
Creating this repository to contribute to [Hacktoberfest 2025](https://hacktoberfest.com/). 

This will be an open-source library of mainly free or low cost learning resources for fellow IT nerds who want to learn about the exciting world of quantum computing. It is full of mystery and excitement, and can be at times a bit difficult to wrap our brains around. âœ¨

# Topics Covered:
- What is Quantum computing? (Plain language explanation in English, translations welcomed and appreciated!!)
- Understanding qubits and how they differ from classical bits
- Core concepts- superposition, entanglement, quantum gates, etc.
- Intro to related algorithms (Grover's, Shor's)
- Recommended online courses (Coursera, etc.)
- Recommended media (Youtube links, books, textbooks)
